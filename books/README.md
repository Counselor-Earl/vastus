# Vastus / Books

This directory is the common parent for all Vastus books.
Subdirectories of books should be chapters.

## Book Scope

:info: The scope of a book should be clearly set in the book/README.md. 
Intuitive concepts for books would usually be for selected time periods
or geographic areas of the Vastus world. Books should contain enough
setting, characters and story arcs to feel like any adventure manual.
They do not have to be redunant, that is what the _Origins, Settings and Geography_
book(s) are for: the common basis information.

## Origins, Settings and Geography

These are book topics that we anticipate. Please start them in the _author_notes_
directory first.

## Anticipated World Epochs

These are the general time periods:

* Before the astral titan meteor strike
* Astral plane adventures before, during and after the meteor strike
* Post-Strike adventure time periods:
    * aftermath of the strike
    * the new societies that form
    * the first Rodorax incursion
    * the demon incursion
    * the hobgoblin occupation
    * the rise of Sing'Jar as a power
    * the Yuan'Ti empire
    * the Yuan'Ti downfall

## Accessory Topics

Semi-book like scopes, like appendix chapters, glossaries, and world
tables should start off in the _author_notes_ directory. This is so that
we can revise drafts on that content before we approve it for _book_scope_.

* ruklaf
* astral titan corpse
* Vastus peculiarities
    * minotaurs
    * yuan'ti
